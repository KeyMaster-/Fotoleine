- if active_idxs is empty in loaded_dir, things just crash
  - happens e.g. if you filter for a rating that hasn't been assigned to anything
  - hide all "current idx" dependent api behind another api object
    - current path, current image, current rating, etc. basically everything that indexes into active_idxs

  alternative if to make current_idx an option that's None if active_idxs is empty, but then everything talking about current returns options, so why bother

- check that load updates are issued when filter is changed. 
  - seeing some cases where right after changing filter the image to the right is still loading

- fix phantom duplicate inputs
  - sometimes you skip ahead 2 images instead of 1
  - current theory is that this is somehow linked to the texture upload pause

- figure out why worker_pool does a 1s wait before executing any worker task
  There's no comment on the line, and the commit that added it has no further context either.
